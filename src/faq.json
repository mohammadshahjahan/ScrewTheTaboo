      "question": "Why do we have periods, and what exactly are they?",
      "answer": "The body of a woman sheds tissue it no longer need during her period, to put it simply. This tissue originates from the female body's uterus, which is where a fetus can grow. The uterine lining thickens roughly every month to accommodate a fertilized egg should the woman get pregnant. The lining is released from the body through the vagina if the egg is not fertilized. Menstruation or a period are the names for this monthly occurrence."

      "question": "How does it feel to get a period?",
      "answer": "When your period is actually flowing, it doesn't feel like much. Most likely, you won't even notice it leaving your body. When your period truly begins, you can experience some moistness in that area; this could be the result of a few blood stains on your underwear."

      "question": "Does it smell to be on your period?",
      "answer": "Not at all! When menstruation fluid comes into touch with air, a menstrual odor develops. There shouldn't be an odor when menstrual fluid is absorbed within the vagina, such as with a tampon, because it isn't exposed to the air. Simply remember to replace your pads and tampons frequently to help prevent odor if you're concerned."

      "answer": "Although menstruation doesn't hurt, some girls and women have uncomfortable cramps or other symptoms during their periods. The hormones your body releases during menstruation, which cause the uterus to contract so it may shed its lining, are usually to blame for this."
